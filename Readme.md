# Node/Express Basics

This is a small tutorial made for new Node.js developers, this aims to teach newcomers how to set up a express server for their next back-end.

## What is Node.js?

> Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/). 

Node.js is a V8 wrapper which allows us to run JavaScript code in our computer  without the use of a web browser, it has access to many powerful API and access to the OS resources like the File System. Node is written in C++ 

While Node is mostly seen as plain JavaScript, it is executed in another way

Both Chrome and Node DO NOT know how to run/interpret JavaScript, they send  the code to the V8 engine which sends back the results. V8 is written in C++ this means that when we are sending code de V8 we are actually executing some C++ function and not JavaScript code.

## Why use Node.js?

Everyday new developers are jumping into Node.js. Node is great for the whole stack. 

> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 

"non-blocking I/O" means that Node will not interrupt the code execution while an  operation with the I/O is in progress say Querying a database, this  started in the browser where the blocking of the I/O would freeze the  whole web page. 

This means function execution will be overall better performance wise, since operations are not invoked in a linear fashion.

> Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world 

Node Package Manager, is a package manager which manages all of our  project's dependencies, this includes installing, uninstalling, updating and maintaining our packets.  A package in a nutshell is someone's code which is uploaded into [npm.js' official website](https://www.npmjs.com/), here code is identified by a unique name. We can use this code however we wish to for our own applications or we can some else's package to develop our own packages.
